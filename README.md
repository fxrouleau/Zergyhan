<h1 align="center">Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

I'm Felix from Quebec, Canada :canada:. I enjoy toying around with code on my free time and trying to learn new technologies.
I love back-end development, enjoying the whole implementation part. I'm trying to learn more front-end related software, as they're needed
in a web-based environment and, to be honest, is needed to show off my work online (mostly with WASM) :sweat_smile:

## Tech Stack
AWS, :hearts: C :hearts:, C++, C#, Java, Jupyter, Python, :crab: Rust :crab:, Docker, Git, :hearts: Jetbrains :hearts:, sklearn

## To learn
Embedded Development, D, Go, Kubernetes, Mobile Development, React, OpenGL, Unity, Unreal Engine, Vulcan, Webpack, Zig

## Get Better At
CI/CD, Node, Haskell, JavaScript/TypeScript
