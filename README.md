<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋</h1>

I'm Felix from Quebec, Canada. I enjoy toying around with code on my free time and trying to learn new methods and technologies.
I love back-end development, enjoying the whole implementation part. I'm trying to learn more front-end related software, as they're needed
in a web-based environment and, to be honest, is needed to show off my work online (mostly with WASM) :sweat_smile:

## Tech Stack
AWS, C, C++, C#, Java, Jupyter, Python, :crab: Rust :crab:, Docker, Git, :hearts: Jetbrains :hearts:, sklearn,
